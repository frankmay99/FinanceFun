# FinanceFun
This GitHub is to keep note of what Im looking at, which is mostly coming from a Python for Finance book I'm making my way through at the moment. Uni is pretty intense at the moment with lecturers taking the opportunity of COVID-19 to pile a lot more work on us, which with masters/internship applications added on top mean additions to this may be more sporadic than I'd want.
